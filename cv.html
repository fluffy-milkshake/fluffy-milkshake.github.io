    <h1>Hey, I'm Ros.</h1>

    <h2>ME, TODAY</h2>
      <p>
        These days I prefer making over managing. I freelance and dedicate my
        remaining time to my creative projects and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚úçüèº I <strong>write</strong> about how to do async remote work with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#127908 I <strong>facilitate</strong> Make Time workshops with my
        human-centred friends at <a href="https://www.forgewell.co/">Forgewell</a>. We help teams structure their
        workload to be healthier, happier, productive humans. I've run workshops
        for Google, Ofgem, L'Oreal, Kiehl's, Biotherm and Yves Saint Laurent
        beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        üë©üèº‚Äçüíª I <strong>design and build</strong> easy operation systems for
        solopreneurs and small businesses. While some people find making systems
        tedious, I love it. Smooth systems recover your time to strategise, and
        work deeply on what matters to you. My motto: "I want better problems".
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about: Simple unbloated solutions, doing generous work, heartfelt
        and meaningful conversations, and savouring the slow road to mastery.
      </p>
    <h2>COMPANIES I STARTED:</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Founder, Time Flow</h3>
        <h4>2021 - now, Remote</h4>
        <p>
          I speak and write about smarter ways of working async in a remote
          environment. I build uncomplicated operation systems for solopreneurs
          and small businesses for your days to feel more cool, calm, and
          'cucumber-ed'
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Co-founder &amp; COO, Affiliate World Conferences</h3>
        <h4>2015 - 2020, London / Remote</h4>
        <p>
          Under my tenure, the company turned over $27M in revenue. Thrasio
          acquired AWC in 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed the brand identity; built the operation systems; managed
          the finances; oversaw developing bespoke technology systems; and
          developed the marketing and sponsorship strategies. I recruited and
          managed a fulltime team of 30 with offices in London, Manila, and
          remote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside leading the business, I directed the production of the 3-day
          live events in London, Bangkok, Berlin, and Barcelona. 22,500+ people
          attended and 1,200+ companies exhibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, I finessed my operation processes doing remote work (before it
          was mainstreamish).
        </p>
      </section>
    <h2>EVENT / FILM PRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>
      As a producer, I'm adept at running a smooth operation. I have 13 years
      experience managing film and large-scale events, with my events being
      attended by more than 25,000 people. I've led productions in the UK,
      Spain, Germany, Thailand, India, and New Zealand. My short film, "Kamali",
      won several international awards, received a 2020 BAFTA award nomination,
      and was long-listed for an Academy Award.
