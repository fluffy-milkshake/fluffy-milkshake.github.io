<h2>ME, TODAY</h2>
<p>
  These days I prefer making over managing. I freelance and dedicate my
  remaining time to my creative projects and learning.
</p>
<p>
  ‚úçüèº I <strong>write</strong> about how to do async remote work with ease.
</p>
<p>
  &#127908 I <strong>facilitate</strong> Make Time workshops with my
  human-centred friends at <a href="https://www.forgewell.co/">Forgewell</a>. We help teams structure their
  workload to be healthier, happier, productive humans. I've run workshops
  for Google, Ofgem, L'Oreal, Kiehl's, Biotherm and Yves Saint Laurent
  beauty.
</p>
<p>
  üë©üèº‚Äçüíª I <strong>design and build</strong> easy operation systems for
  solopreneurs and small businesses. While some people find making systems
  tedious, I love it. Smooth systems recover your time to strategise, and
  work deeply on what matters to you. My motto: "I want better problems".
</p>
<p>
  I care about: Simple unbloated solutions, doing generous work, heartfelt
  and meaningful conversations, and savouring the slow road to mastery.
</p>
<h2>COMPANIES I STARTED:</h2>
<section>
  <h4 span class="date">2021 - now</span></h4>
  <h3>Founder, Time Flow</h3>
  <h4>Remote</h4>
  <p>
    I speak and write about smarter ways of working async in a remote
    environment. I build uncomplicated operation systems for solopreneurs
    and small businesses for your days to feel more cool, calm, and
    'cucumber-ed'
  </p>

<section>
  <h4 span class="date">2015 - 2020</span></h4>
  <h3>Co-founder &amp; COO, Affiliate World Conferences</h3>
  <h4>London / Remote</h4>
  <p>
    Under my tenure, the company turned over $27M in revenue. Thrasio
    acquired AWC in 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    I developed the brand identity; built the operation systems; managed
    the finances; oversaw developing bespoke technology systems; and
    developed the marketing and sponsorship strategies. I recruited and
    managed a fulltime team of 30 with offices in London, Manila, and
    remote.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside leading the business, I directed the production of the 3-day
    live events in London, Bangkok, Berlin, and Barcelona. 22,500+ people
    attended and 1,200+ companies exhibited.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, I finessed my operation processes doing remote work (before it
    was mainstreamish).
  </p>

<h2>EVENT / FILM PRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
As a producer, I'm adept at running a smooth operation. I have 13 years
experience managing film and large-scale events, with my events being
attended by more than 25,000 people. I've led productions in the UK,
Spain, Germany, Thailand, India, and New Zealand. My short film, "Kamali",
won several international awards, received a 2020 BAFTA award nomination,
and was long-listed for an Academy Award.
