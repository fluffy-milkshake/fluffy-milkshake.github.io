    <p>Hi, I'm Ros</p>
    <p>Me (in short)</p>
    <p>→ I co-founded an events company that made $27M over five years.</p>
    <p>→ Then I burned out. So, I left everything to design my life with intention, around creativity and connection.</p>
    <p>→ Today, (professionally) I'm a producer and facilitator, and (amateurly, but eagerly) I code. </p>
    <p>→ I study philosophy and consciousness.</p>
    <p>Aotearoa NZ raised. I now live in the UK.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm an indie web aficionada, so no socials. But you should write to me; I always respond. And still send postcards.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can see more about me (in long) <a href="./cv.html">on my CV</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm tracking my coding progress on this <a href="./calendar.html">calendar here</a>.</p>
